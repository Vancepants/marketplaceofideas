## Welcome to the MOI Project

In the age of cryptoeconomics, we believe that token holders are **stakeholders**, part-contributors and part-owners. Much like an investor who holds stock in a traditional publicly financed company, token holders have rights.


### Rights of Investors
* Investors have a **right to transparency** into project status and project updates.
* Investors have a **right to influence** the direction of a project, equal to the relevant stake they've invested.
* Investors have a **right to data** access, insofar as that data reflects the performance of the project and need not be kept confidential. 

These rights are influenced by U.S. securities exchange laws designed to protect investors from fraudulent enterprises. At a time when ICOs are raising millions in financing with only promises of a product offering, such protections are in dire need.

These rights can be standardized without intervention from regulators. 

All that's needed is a willing community.


### Getting Started, Getting Involved

The MOI Project is building a platform that connects investors and project teams **beyond the initial coin offering**. 
* A successfully financed organization must provide regular, transparent updates to token holders. 
* Token holders provide feedback on those updates and vote on high-level priorities. 

Our platform aggregates news, data, and discourse on any given project, facilitates the interaction between parties, and provides a public rating of the project based on stakeholder satisfaction levels. 

And that's just the beginning.

Contribute now by providing market research data. No technical experience necessary.
