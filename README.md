## Welcome to the MOI Project

In the age of cryptoeconomics, we believe that token holders are **stakeholders**, part-contributors and part-owners. Much like an investor who holds stock in a traditional publicly financed company, token holders have rights.

### Rights of Investors
* Investors have a **right to transparency** into project status and project updates.
* Investors have a **right to influence** the direction of a project, equal to the relevant stake they've invested.
* Investors have a **right to data** access, insofar as that data reflects the performance of the project and need not be kept confidential. 

These rights are influenced by U.S. securities exchange laws designed to protect investors from fraudulent enterprises. At a time when ICOs are raising millions in financing with only promises of a product offering, such protections are in dire need.

These rights can be standardized without intervention from regulators. All that is needed is a willing community.
