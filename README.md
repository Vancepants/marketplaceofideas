## Welcome to the MOI Project

In the age of cryptoeconomics, we believe that token holders are **stakeholders**, part-contributors and part-owners. Much like an investor who holds stock, token holders have rights.


### Rights of Investors
* Token holders have a **right to transparency** into project status and project updates.
* Token holders have a **right to influence** the direction of a project.
* Token holders have a **right to access data**.

>*These rights are influenced by U.S. securities exchange laws designed to protect investors from fraudulent enterprises. At a time when ICOs are raising millions in financing with only promises of a product offering, such protections are in dire need.*


### Getting Started, Getting Involved

The MOI Project is building a platform that connects investors and project teams **beyond the initial coin offering**.

* A successfully financed organization must provide regular, transparent updates to token holders. 
* Token holders provide feedback on those updates and vote on high-level priorities. 

The Marketplace of Ideas aggregates news, data, and discourse on any given project, facilitates the interaction between parties, and provides a public rating of the project based on stakeholder satisfaction levels. 

And that's just the beginning.
